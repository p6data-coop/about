# p6data.coop 

This repository is now obsolete. Work on open data and mapping is being continued by the Solidarity Economy Association in the repository https://github.com/SolidarityEconomyAssociation/open-data-and-maps. 

During 2015, various people were coming to the same conclusion, that there is a need to collaborate on the creation of robust, accessible [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) about the Social and Solidarity Economy. 
One of those was Karin Christiansen, General Secretary of [The Co-operative Party](http://party.coop/), who set up the [p6data.coop](http://p6data.coop/) website.
At the same time, the people at the [Solidarity Economy Association](https://www.solidarityeconomy.coop/) (formerly called the Institute for Solidarity Economics) were having a similar idea, but also wanted to include initiatives in the wider Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE), as well as co-operatives.

The name p6data is taken from [Co-operative Principle](http://ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles) number 6: Co-operation among Co-operatives. It applies equally to co-operation among initiatives within the wider SSE.

This repository provides a space to share work in progress. [The issue tracker](https://github.com/p6data-coop/about/issues) is acting as our space for open information sharing in efforts to develop a common approach to co-operative data. 

# The p6data problem
At the moment, listings of retail co-operatives, credit unions, community pubs, fans trusts and other parts of our movement are kept by a range of organisations, and in formats that aren't always easily searchable or compatible.

Our core goal is simple. To agree a way of bringing them together in one place so that the information is searchable, sortable, and free for anyone to use. 

## The journey so far

So far, we've:

* Hosted a couple of calls of interested parties;
* Agreed to start sharing existing open data on the sector;
* Set up [p6data.coop](http://www.p6data.coop) as a public face for the project;
* Held a [Hack Day](http://solidarityeconomics.org/2016/01/06/notes-from-coop-data-hackday/) at the Institute for Solidarity Economics in Oxford, December 2015. 
* Published the [ISE Strategy for Data](http://solidarityeconomics.org/2016/02/16/ise-strategy-for-data/);
* Set up the [ise-linked-open-data](https://github.com/p6data-coop/ise-linked-open-data) repository for the Institute of Solidarity Economics' implementation of Linked Open Data on their own server.
* The Solidarity Economy Association has published Co-ops UK 2016 open data as linked open data and created a [map-app](http://data.solidarityeconomics.org/map-app/) to view it on a map and to explore the experimental data.
* Further development work will continue in the repository https://github.com/SolidarityEconomyAssociation/open-data-and-maps.
