# p6data.coop

During 2015, various people were coming to the same conclusion, that there is a need to collaborate on the creation of robust, accessible [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) about the Social and Solidarity Economy. 
One of those was Karin Christiansen, General Secretary of [The Co-operative Party](http://party.coop/), who set up the [p6data.coop](http://p6data.coop/) website.
At the same time, the people at the [Institute for Solidarity Economics](http://www.solidarityeconomics.org) were having a similar idea, but also wanted to include initiatives in the wider Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE), as well as co-operatives.

The name p6data is taken from [Co-operative Principle](http://ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles) number 6: Co-operation among Co-operatives. It applies equally to co-operation among initiatives within the wider SSE.

This repository provides a space to share work in progress. [The issue tracker](https://github.com/p6data-coop/about/issues) is acting as our space for open information sharing in efforts to develop a common approach to co-operative data. 

### New to GitHub?

Initially, we're mainly using the discussion features in the issue tracker. You can think of it just like a forum. Sign-up for a free personal GitHub account, and then you can add your own new issues and comments to the discussions. 

Once logged in, you can 'Watch' the issues, getting e-mail notification of updates, and the ability to reply to discussion by e-mail.

# The p6data problem
At the moment, listings of retail co-operatives, credit unions, community pubs, fans trusts and other parts of our movement are kept by a range of organisations, and in formats that aren't always easily searchable or compatible.

Our core goal is simple. To agree a way of bringing them together in one place so that the information is searchable, sortable, and free for anyone to use. 

## The journey so far

So far, we've:

* Hosted a couple of calls of interested parties;
* Agreed to start sharing existing open data on the sector;
* Set up [p6data.coop](http://www.p6data.coop) as a public face for the project;
* Published the [ISE Strategy for Data](http://solidarityeconomics.org/2016/02/16/ise-strategy-for-data/);
